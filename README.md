# MBDA 
This GitHub page is a way for the team to easily access some information online versus searching through files on your desk or computer.

## How GitHub works
We wont go into the complex things, but git is basically a collaborative tool for programmers that we can repurpose for our benefit. I originally made this account for the CRM Style Guide, but the things that we can do on git are almost limitless.

## How To Use Git
- The Main page will have folders and files that you can access online.
- I will be as descriptive as possible when naming a file so that you konow exactly what you are accessing
 - ex. `CRM_Style_Guide.md`
- Unless youd like to fully learn how to use git, If you have a file or information that youd like to store that make sense using git, send it to Chaz and he will get it up
